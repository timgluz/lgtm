# The Triple-R Pattern

If you find yourself struggling to compose a comment that asks for a change,
try what I call the Triple-R pattern (alternatively “R-Cubed” or affectionately, “RRR”! pattern):

### Triple-R Pattern

**Request**: A sentence explaining what you’d like the author to do.

**Rationale**: A sentence or two explaining why the request is warranted.
Include references or links to justify and support your request.

**Result**: A measurable end state the author can compare their change to.
This could be a metric to reach, a screenshot of an intended state, or quite literally, what the code should look like after the change.
